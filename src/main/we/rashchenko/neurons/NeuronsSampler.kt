 * Factory for the [Neuron].

 *  about all previously sampled
 *  neurons of that type to sample more successful neurons in the future.
 * Warning, it is prohibited to save references to previously sampled neurons inside the [NeuronsSampler].
 * To save meta-info with which [Neuron] was sampled use some separate classes.
 * We need that restriction to not let the [NeuronsSampler] to modify previously sampled neurons.
 * [Neuron] should use only local information.
 * For more info about such restrictions check [ChNN competition rules][TODO], [Loopholes discussion][TODO].
 * There you can suggest solutions how to integrate such restriction into the code architecture instead of text rules.
 * TODO maybe we can check it by objects graph connectivity (like we do it for memory consumption tests)?
